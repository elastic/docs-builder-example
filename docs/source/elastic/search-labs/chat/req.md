To follow this tutorial you will need to install the following components:

- An installation of Elasticsearch, based on our hosted [Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/cloud) service (which includes a free trial period), or a self-hosted service that you run on your own computer. See the [Install Elasticsearch](../index.md) section above for installation instructions.
- An API Key for OpenAI. You can actually use any other LLM that you favor, as long as it is supported by the [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/) project.
- A [Python](https://python.org) interpreter. Make sure it is a recent version, such as Python 3.8 or newer.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

This tutorial focuses on RAG topics. To be able to modify the example application you will need basic knowledge of the following technologies:

- Python back end development with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/).
- TypeScript front end development with [React](https://react.dev/).
