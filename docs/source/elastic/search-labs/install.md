title: "Install Elasticsearch"

In this section you will learn about some of the options you have for running Elasticsearch. Most of the tutorials and content on this site will require you to first follow the instructions below for your chosen method of installation.

## How to run Elasticsearch

In this section we will cover two convenient installation options for Elasticsearch:

- [Elastic Cloud](install/cloud.md) - Good option for development and production environments. Elastic Cloud is a hosted Elasticsearch and Kibana service available on AWS, GCP, and Azure. It offers a 14-day free trial.
- [Docker](install/docker.md) - Good option for local development and testing.

Note that these aren't the only ways to deploy Elasticsearch. You can find a discussion of other deployment options in the [Elasticsearch Installation Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html).
