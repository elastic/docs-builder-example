The mapping of the destination index—the index that contains the embeddings that the model will create based on your input text—must be created. The destination index must have a field with the [`dense_vector`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/dense-vector.html) field type for most models and the [`sparse_vector`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/sparse-vector.html) field type for the sparse vector models like in the case of the elser service to index the output of the used model.
