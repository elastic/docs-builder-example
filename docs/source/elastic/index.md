title: Elastic content
---

The goal of this section is to demo real Elastic documentation in Elastic Docs v3. Please feel free to add your own examples.

Here's what we have so far:

* [Semantic search with the inference API](semantic-search/index.md) — A partial port of an existing tutorial with many different services to choose from. Currently hosted [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/semantic-search-inference.html).
* [Search Labs Tutorial](search-labs/index.md) — A partial port of the Search Labs Tutorials content currently hosted [here](https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/tutorials).
* [Automated Settings Reference](reference/index.md) — An example of an automatically automated setting
* [Observability overview](observability/index.md) — Nothing special, just a bunch of images and text.
