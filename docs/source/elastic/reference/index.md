Elastic docs v3 supports automatically generated configuration documentation OOTB.
Simply supply a yaml spec and corresponding template file and content will be automatically built and updated.

This section includes one example yaml file and two auto-generated outputs based on that file:

* [example `yaml` file](source.md)
* [generated output](generated.md)
