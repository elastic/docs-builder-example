Before you start installing ECE, make sure you identify your deployment scenario and prepare your hosts.

You can get ECE up and running using the official bash script on a public cloud or on your own premises.
Alternatively, you can install ECE with the Ansible playbook.
The ECE Ansible playbook is a community project, supported by Elastic, aimed at installing ECE at scale.

Once you have installed ECE, check some final post-installation steps to get ready for production.
