This will include an intro paragraph of what this guide covers.

## Why it’s important to upgrade

Sample text: Upgrading provides you access to Elastic’s latest features, enhancements, and bug fixes, many of which enable you to save your organization money, respond faster to potential threats, and improve the tools you use to investigate and analyze your data. Also, it’s important to ensure that your deployment is fully maintained and supported. For more information, refer to [Elastic’s Product End of Life Dates](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol).
